eDelivery xsd schemas v0.5
===

This contains edelivery xsd schema proposals for edelivery message payloads (v0.5) in 
- Gate to gate (g2g) communication:
  - **identifierQuery** -> identifierResponse - find consignments (identifier subset only) matching the given identifier
  - **uilQuery** -> uilResponse - find consignment (in a given subset) using uil
- Platform to gate (p2g) communication:
  - **saveIdentifiersRequest** -> saveIdentifiersResponse - save consignment identifiers to the gate. This request is used to create and update the identifier dataset.
- Gate to platform (g2p) communication
  - **uilQuery** -> uilResponse - find consignment (in a given subset) using uil

Schemas:
- **[edelivery/gate.xsd](edelivery/gate.xsd)** - edelivery message payloads for gates. Includes platform payloads and g2g payloads. This contains all the message payloads.
- **[edelivery/platform.xsd](edelivery/platform.xsd)** - edelivery message payloads for platforms. Contains message payloads for p2g and g2p.
- **[consignment-common.xsd](consignment-common.xsd)** - efti common dataset consignment
- **[consignment-identifier.xsd](consignment-identifier.xsd)** - identifier subset of efti common dataset consignment.

Model
-
Data model is based on 
- https://unece.org/trade/uncefact/unccl and
- https://svn.gefeg.com/svn/efti-publication/Draft/CDS/ds1.htm

Efti common dataset and identifier subset are both based on this same model.

Data model is visualized here:
- common dataset: https://model.fintraffic-efti-poc.aws.fintraffic.cloud/#efti
- identifier subset: https://model.fintraffic-efti-poc.aws.fintraffic.cloud/#identifier

Element names are derived from un/ccl as:
- use 82th column (Short Name) from un/ccl 
- remove invalid characters -, _, /
- first character in lower case
- rename iD -> id

Complex type names are derived from un/ccl as:
- concat columns 8 (Object Class Term Qualifiers) and 9 (Object Class Term)
- remove invalid characters -, _, /

Element max cardinality is derived from un/ccl as (name : type):
- id : Identifier -> 1
- code : CountryIdentifier -> 1
- else: use column 21 (Occurrence Max)

Examples

XML example documents:

- consignment.xml - example consignment xml document (identifier subset of efti common dataset)
- consignment-common.xml - example consignment xml document of common dataset
- identifier-query - example payload for identifiers search request to other gate
- identifier-response - example payload for identifiers search response to other gate
- uil-query - example payload for uil query request to other gate
- uil-response - example payload for uil query response to other gate

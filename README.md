# eFTI4EU Reference Implementation

This project contains the code base of the reference implementation for the eFTI4EU regulation. The project is still in progress and no release is issued yet. Once released, involved member states can use it as a base code, base architecture or test reference for their national implementation.

## Content of the reference implementation

The reference implementation contains the minimal code base to run and test the eFTI gate in conformance with the eFTI4EU regulation. It is developped and maintained by different member states involved in this project.
